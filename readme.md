# Bringing it All Together - C, CMake, SDL3, Callbacks, Emscripten, Images, Sounds, Fonts

This project is meant to help others understand a valid way of bringing many
related SDL technologies together. These are:

- C
- CMake
- SDL3 (using the Callbacks system)
- SDL_Mixer
- SDL_TTF
- SDL_Image
- Emscripten

## Overview

This project is a C project that is built with CMake. All of the SDL dependencies are
downloaded into your build folder. Further, the project works with the Emscripten platform as well as native.

## Build Instructions

For Native builds:

1. make a `build` folder, and `cd` to it.
2. run `cmake ..`
3. run `make`
4. run the executable `./bralltog`

For browser builds using Emscripten

0. ensure `emsdk` is installed and sourced to your shell.
1. make an `emscripten` folder.
2. copy the `runserver.sh` script to it. This assumes python is present.
3. navigate to your new `emscripten` folder.
4. run `emcmake cmake ..`
5. run `emmake make && ./runserver.sh`

## Final Words

I hope this helps newcomers to SDL development in C get started more quickly.
